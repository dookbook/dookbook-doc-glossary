# Constant

A **constant** is a value that the programmer **cannot change**, for example numbers (`1`, `2`, `42`).
With *variables*, on the other hand, the programmer can assign a new value to a
variable name already in use.

Like variables, some constants are bound to [identifiers](/en/glossary/identifier). For example, the
identifier `pi` could be bound to the value `3.14...`.
