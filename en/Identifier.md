TOPIC: Identifier

# Identifier

An **identifier** is a *sequence of characters* in the code that identifies a **variable**,
**function**, or **property**.

In [[JavaScript]], identifiers are *case-sensitive* and can contain *Unicode letters*, *`$`*, *`_`*,
and *digits* (`0`-`9`), but may *not start with a digit*.

An identifier differs from a string in that a string is data, while an identifier is part of the code.
In [[JavaScript]], there is no way to convert identifiers to strings,
but sometimes it is possible to parse strings into identifiers.
